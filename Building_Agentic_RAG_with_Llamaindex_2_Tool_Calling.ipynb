    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code integrates various tools to perform automated function execution and document information retrieval using the LlamaIndex framework and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. Initially, it defines simple function tools (add and mystery) and uses a language model to predict and call these functions based on user input. It then sets up an auto-retrieval tool by loading a document, splitting it into chunks, creating a vector store index, and performing filtered vector queries to retrieve specific information from the document. Additionally, a summary index and a summary query tool are defined to provide comprehensive document summaries, enabling the system to intelligently respond to queries about document content and specific sections."

      "The paper introduces MetaGPT, a meta-programming framework for multi-agent collaboration based on Large Language Models (LLMs). MetaGPT incorporates Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) to enhance collaboration efficiency and reduce errors among agents. It utilizes role specialization, structured communication interfaces, and executable feedback mechanisms to streamline workflows. Through extensive experiments and evaluations on various datasets, MetaGPT demonstrates superior performance in code generation benchmarks, outperforming existing frameworks. The framework is designed to enhance problem-solving capabilities in multi-agent systems by modeling agents as a simulated software company, emphasizing role specialization, workflow management, and efficient communication mechanisms. MetaGPT also introduces the concept of AgentStore for managing agents with different capabilities. The paper discusses the system's ability to generate functional applications, simplify software development processes, and achieve high performance in completing tasks, especially when using GPT-4 as the backend. It also addresses challenges, limitations, and ethical concerns related to the system's capabilities and impact on users.\n"
